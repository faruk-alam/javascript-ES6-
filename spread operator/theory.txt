The spread operator, which is also denoted by (...), performs the exact opposite function of the rest operator.
The spread operator spreads out (i.e. splits up) an array and passes the values into the specified function.
The spread operator ... is used to expand or spread an iterable or an array. For example,

const arrValue = ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Jack'];

console.log(arrValue);   // ["My", "name", "is", "Jack"]
console.log(...arrValue); // My name is Jack
In this case, the code:

console.log(...arrValue)
is equivalent to:

console.log('My', 'name', 'is', 'Jack');
