JavaScript for...of loop :

The for...of loop was introduced in the later versions of JavaScript ES6.
The for..of loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over iterable objects (arrays, sets, maps, strings etc).

The syntax of the for...of loop is:

for (element of iterable) {
    // body of for...of
}
Here,
iterable - an iterable object (array, set, strings, etc).
element - items in the iterable
In plain English, you can read the above code as: for every element in the iterable, run the body of the loop.
