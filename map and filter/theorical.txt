JavaScript Map :

Map is similar to objects in JavaScript that allows us to store elements in a key/value pair.

The elements in a Map are inserted in an insertion order. However, unlike an object, a map can contain objects, 
functions and other data types as key.
Points to remember
A map object cannot contain the duplicate keys.
A map object can contain the duplicate values.
The key and value can be of any type (allows both object and primitive values).
A map object iterates its elements in insertion order.

The filter() Array method creates a new array with elements that fall under a given criteria from an existing 
array.
