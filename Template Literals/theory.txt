Template Literals:

Template literals provide an easy and clean way create multi-line strings and perform string interpolation. 
Now we can embed variables or expressions into a string at any spot without any hassle.
Template literals are created using back-tick (` `) (grave accent) character instead of the usual double or 
single quotes. Variables or expressions can be placed inside the string using the ${...} syntax
