JavaScript for...in loop :
There are also other types of loops. The for..in loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over all property 
keys of an object.
The syntax of the for...in loop is:

for (key in object) {
    // body of for...in
}
In each iteration of the loop, a key is assigned to the key variable. The loop continues for all object 
properties.

Note: Once you get keys, you can easily find their corresponding values.
